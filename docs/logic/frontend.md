# Frontend

Here is a Figma prototype demonstrating the different screens used in the application. Figma file can be found here: [Vibe Beyond Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/xq9BHN9FgZP1IP13KOOU0J/Vibes-Beyond-Wireframe?node-id=321%3A179&scaling=contain&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=319%3A33).

## Start Screen
![Start screen](./../assets/images/wf_start.png)
* No opening transition. Start with this background and button already visible.
* The text "vibe beyond" should have the text appear as if it is being typed in. 
    * Optional: The vertical bar to the right would blink after as if it were an editor cursor.

## Playing Screen
![Playing screen](./../assets/images/wf_playing.png)
* Transition from Start Screen by:
    * Fading whole screen to white (quickly), starting the music, and fading into playing screen (with white corners already included).
* Have all text on the screen appear through the typing animation from before

## Play to Pause Screen
![Play to pause](./../assets/images/wf_playpause.png)
* Splash the screen and show the pause character (2 uppercase letter I's in Montserrat) in the center of the screen

## Pause to Play
![Pause to play](./../assets/images/wf_pauseplay.png)
* Same as above

## Toggle History
![Toggle history](./../assets/images/wf_history.png)
* Animate purple banner by flying in from the right to the left. Fade in and slightly fly down each text box/vertical bar in the banner.
