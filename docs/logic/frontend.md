# Frontend

Here are some images from Figma illustrating the different screens used in the application. Figma file can be found here: [Vibe Beyond Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/66tZ8kdzd7ltYovCvs25tl/Vibe-Beyond-wireframe?t=qoi9xIYPsI596K1e-6).

## Start Screen
![Start screen](./../assets/images/Wireframe_Start.png)
* No opening transition. Start with this background and button already visible.
* The text "vibe beyond" should have the text appear as if it is being typed in. 
    * Optional: The vertical bar to the right would blink after as if it were an editor cursor.

## Playing Screen
![Playing screen](./../assets/images/Wireframe_Playing.png)
* Transition from Start Screen by:
    * Fading whole screen to white (quickly), starting the music, and fading into playing screen (with white corners already included).
* Have all text on the screen appear through the typing animation from before

## Play to Pause Screen
![Play to pause](./../assets/images/Wireframe_PlayPause.png)

## Pause to Play
![Pause to play](./../assets/images/Wireframe_PausePlay.png)
* Same as above

## Toggle History
