Unfortunately, I'm not looking for any new developers to contribute code to the VibeBeyond repository. If you have some suggestions for features or issues that you'd like to bring up, please add a detailed issue to the repository [here](https://github.com/dariustb/VibeBeyond/issues).

However, if you'd like to donate to the cause, I do take donations via [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/sleepy)

Thank you!
