# Testing
For this project, I'm currently using different technologies and methodologies to make this iteration of the program work. All that I'm using are currently freely available to add to your own project and will only need to be created into a workflow to integrate into your CI.

## Testing Libraries
These are the libraries I'm incorporating into the CI:
- [Gtest Suite](http://google.github.io/googletest/): Unit & integration testing
- [CodeCov](https://about.codecov.io/language/c-plus-plus/): Test coverage reports
- [Clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/): Linting checks

I'm just pushing buttons hoping something works!
