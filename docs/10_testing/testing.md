# Testing
For this project, I'm currently using different technologies and methodologies to make this iteration of the program work. All that I'm using are currently freely available to add to your own project and will only need to be created into a workflow to integrate into your CI.

## Testing Libraries
These are the libraries I'm incorporating into the CI:
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/): Unit & integration testing
- [CodeCov](https://about.codecov.io/language/python/): Test coverage reports (via [Pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
- [Pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Linting checks
- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): Formatter checks
- [Isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/): Import ordering

## Testing Methodologies
I'm currently *trying* to use [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](https://testdriven.io/blog/modern-tdd/) to create fully-tested code for the app. It's my first project utilizing this method, so heads up if you're looking at this as an example for properly using TDD.

I'm just pushing buttons hoping something works!
