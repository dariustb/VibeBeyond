> This website documents the current features of the `main` branch of the VibeBeyond repo. Information may be added or deleted while the repo is continually developed and improved.

Vibe Beyond serves a radio to allow users to listen to AI-generated lofi hip hop music. You can control the volume and play/pause ability while being giving a history of past songs in the queue (all aesthetic, you probably will be the only person to have ever heard the song).

Browse the docs to learn more about how to use this application.
